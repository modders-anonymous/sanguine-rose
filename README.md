# mo2git

**mo2git** is a collection of Python scripts designed to help you work together on Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) modlists using GitHub. It currently works with Wabbajack, but I hope it will eventually run on its own (I‚Äôm still working on improving the speed).

## This project is a Work In Progress! It‚Äôs not ready to use yet. Description below is about the features I'm planning.

## Philosophy

**mo2git** is a helpful tool for MO2 users that makes it easy to collaborate on modlists using GitHub. You can think of it like Wabbajack, but mo2git uses a text format that works well with GitHub. It also allows you to run tools directly on a user‚Äôs computer, instead of making them download lots of files, like BodySlide-generated meshes or DDSOpt-optimized textures. This way, users will run BodySlide or DDSOpt on their own systems, saving lots of download time since they won‚Äôt have to download those gigabytes of files! And the image being smaller makes it easier to share on GitHub too!

In short, mo2git lets multiple people work on different parts of a mod list without interfering with each other. You‚Äôll have features like change tracking and pull requests, which are great for teamwork! ‚ùóüòÄ

Currently, mo2git uses Wabbajack for hashing and creating end-user images. I plan to keep this connection for now, but I want mo2git to eventually work on its own. This will allow sharing modlists that include paid mods, which isn‚Äôt allowed by Wabbajack. Just so you know, mo2git‚Äôs hashing and image creation are currently much slower than Wabbajack‚Äôs, so we will keep using WJ for a while.

## A Word to Modders

### We do not help to rob you
First of all.‚ùó**mo2git and Wabbajack modlists are NOT intended to rob you from your fame, or your money!**‚ùó**With WJ and mo2git modlists, users still need to download your mods wherever you want them to go.** ‚ùóWhile WJ does not allow paid mods, mo2git is completely neutral about it; as a piece of really free software, mo2git doesn't feel like imposing any restrictions on the users, period. 

Besides, mo2git aims to improve your bottom line (whether measured in likes or in bitcoins) by enabling Joe Average user to make complicated setups, and by taking honest users away from those swindling folks who publish those whole downloadable half-terabyte folders. WJ is based on the same concepts as mo2git, but they dislike money-based mods üò±. 

### mo2git project as an automated 'how to build' instruction 

mo2git-based project is essentially just a (machine-executable, but human-readable) *instruction on 'how to build the MO2 folder' from Downloads folder". As in "go to such and such URL, get a file there, unpack it, and copy file X from the archive to this place within MO2 hierarchy". Rinse and repeat 10'000 times.

BTW, with mo2git (and unlike with WJ), you can easily see it on GitHub. master.json is this instruction I'm speaking about. 

## Comparison with Wabbajack
### Similarities with Wabbajack

- You absoulutely must have a pristine Skyrim install. You should even keep SKSE and ENB out of your Skyrim folder by using the Root Builder plugin for MO2.
- You build a portable MO2 setup from "image" and files from your Downloads folder.

### Advantages over Wabbajack

- üìÑ _mo2git_ image is not a monolithic binary. Instead, it is a github project (with JSON file at its heart), with all the changes visible and most of them even understandable.
- üë´ **multiple ppl can now work on the same mo2 modlist.** üëèüëèüëè
- üí∞ modlists with paid mods are perfectly fine. Modders also deserve to get paid, you know. Keep in mind that if you're using WJ, you're still bound by their license.
- üìÇ mod packs. Mod pack is a mo2git-described pack of closely related mods, which are only loosely related to the rest of the mod universe. For example, making a nice-looking female appearance mod pack (such as 3BA) is a piece of art by itself, but it does not interfere too much with environment modding, or with male appearance mod pack, or with quest mods. I hope that with time, there will be various mod packs all over github, so you can choose which ones to use as building blocks for your own modlist. It is all about division of labor and specialization. A special case of mod packs are derived mod lists. 
- üìí change tracking. It is clear what has changed since previous version, and it can be rolled back easily. 
- ‚ôªÔ∏è pull requests from ppl outside of your immediate team. And you decide whethe4r to accept them or not.
- üî®concept of transform: why uploading-downliading all those Bodyslide files, when they can be generated on the end-user box (using the same tools as you use, as all the tools and their config come in the same MO2 folder)?
- [FUTURE] an alternative way (using ReFS's CoW feature) to launch Skyrim without MO2 running and hooking into the game processes, may be a bit cleaner in runtime than MO2 at the cost of longer startup and shutdown times. Will still preserve MO2 compatibility, and will make MO-like development even cleaner than MO itself (I should be able to enforce that all writes go to overwrites, with both Skyrim and mod folders always kept pristine (well, after mo2git restores them back üòâ).

### Downsides Compared to Wabbajack

- ‚ùå No User Interface (UI): If you or someone else wants to create a GitHub project with a UI for mo2git, that would be great! I‚Äôm happy to support that by providing non-UI functions in mo2git, as long as your project uses a permissive license; no copyleft or other restrictions, please. This also means no stuff such as "Any quid-pro-quo payment structure in connection with... is strictly prohibited." either :angry: :rage: :scream: .
- üêå Slower Performance: mo2git is already paralellized and quite optimized, but let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs challenging to compete performance-wise with C# when using Python.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- *Whatever you need to run your modlist.*
- *16GB RAM is a must; 32GB is super recommended.*
- *You‚Äôll also need 2x of extra disk space for your modlist, plus some more.*

### Accounts
- *Steam* - You‚Äôll need this for Skyrim.
- *[NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)* (preferably premium) - You‚Äôll use this for downloads.

### Installed Stuff
- *Steam*
- *Skyrim* (Make sure it‚Äôs a PRISTINE install folder)
- *Wabbajack* from [wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org/). *Don‚Äôt forget to log in to Nexus in WJ Settings! Eventually, this will be optional, but I‚Äôm keeping the integration with WJ (using their hash DB and generating WJ images from mo2git's images).*
- *You don‚Äôt necessarily need MO2 or tools like LOOT or xEdit‚Äîif you set up a COLLABWJ project right, those will get installed into \Modding\MO2 from the Wabbajack image.*
- *MSVC* can be downloaded from [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Just check the `Desktop Development with C++` box. You‚Äôll need this to install the `py7zr` and `bethesda-structs` Python modules.
- *Python v3.10+*. Grab it from [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). The latest version is perfect, and no, I'm not going to support Python 2. Make sure to add `py` to your PATH environment variable.
- You‚Äôll also need the following Python modules: xxhash, psutil, py7zr, and bethesda-structs. To install all of them, simply run `mo2git-pip.bat` from mo2git project. **Prerequisite: MSVC (see above)**

### Recommended
- *GitHub Desktop* [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

## Workflow Using GitHub

So, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôve got your hands on a mo2git-based GitHub modlist. We‚Äôll call it COLLAB. An example of such a project is [KTA](https://github.com/KTAGirl/KTA). Here‚Äôs how to work with it:

1. Install the Wabbajack image using the link from the COLLAB project or build it straight from COLLAB‚Äôs GitHub.
   - Make sure to follow all the usual Wabbajack steps (like having a pristine Skyrim folder).
   - In a well-set-up COLLAB project, you‚Äôll get an MO2 installation with most tools (like Bodyslide, FNIS, etc.) already set up.
   - You‚Äôll also set up your Downloads folder to download your archives (feel free to use your existing Downloads folder, I'm sure you‚Äôve got one, right? üòú).
   
2. Modify your installed modlist in MO2 portable instance (using Mod Organizer and included tools) to make that small change you want to make (think small changes‚Äîit‚Äôs like eating an elephant one bite at a time).
   - In a collaborative setup, keep changes small and merge them quickly. Otherwise, you‚Äôll lose a lot of the GitHub benefits. And if you let your copy sit too long without merging, resolving merge conflicts can get messy.
   
3. Clone the GitHub repo for the COLLAB project and mo2git.
4. Set up your folders:
   - By default, you‚Äôd set up C:\Modding\, with the WJ project in C:\Modding\<COLLAB-WJ>, and the GitHub stuff in C:\Modding\Github\mo2git and C:\Modding\Github\<COLLAB>. It should work with other setups too, but let me know if you hit any issues.
   
5. Run `COLLAB.py -mo2git` from inside the COLLAB folder.
   - This is where the magic happens. It will update your C:\Modding\Github\<COLLAB> to show your changes. 
   - Even though it‚Äôs written in single-threaded Python, it usually wraps up in just a few minutes.
   
6. Now you‚Äôve got your modified C:\Modding\Github\COLLAB. Now you can see the differences and commit directly to the project (if you‚Äôve got permissions) or submit a pull request.
   - To merge:
     - Every time you pull into \Modding\Github\COLLAB, you *have to* run `COLLAB.py -git2mo` (yep, that‚Äôs different from the one above ü§Ø). This updates your \Modding\COLLAB project with new changes from GitHub.
     - If a new COLLAB Wabbajack was released while you were working, you‚Äôll need to install that new Wabbajack file to a SEPARATE folder‚Äîlike C:\\Modding\COLLAB-WJ2\ ‚ùó‚Äîbut still use the same Downloads folder. mo2git doesn‚Äôt use this COLLAB-WJ2 install as is, but WJ will download new files and update its databases, which mo2git will use.
     - After that, keep merging your changes. As long as your edits don‚Äôt mess with the same files as the new GitHub changes, you‚Äôre golden. If there are conflicts, the usual GitHub merge rules apply for text files, and mo2git tries to keep binary file changes separate, so sometimes it‚Äôll still work out. Just know that conflicts can still happen, but it‚Äôs pretty rare IRL.
     - ([Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) is super recommended, but if you love the command line, that works too!)
   
7. You‚Äôre all done with your change!
   
8. To pull the new version, you‚Äôll need to:
   - Pull the new version of \Modding\Github\COLLAB
   - If available, install the new Wabbajack to \Modding\COLLAB-WJ2
   - Run `COLLAB.py -git2mo`

I know it sounds complicated, especially if you‚Äôre used to solo modding, but the perks of working together on modlists, like one person handling NPCs, another tweaking the environment, and someone else working on ENB or scripting‚Äîare huge!
