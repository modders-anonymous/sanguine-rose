# mo2git

**mo2git** is a collection of Python scripts designed to help you work together on Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) modlists using GitHub. It currently works with Wabbajack, but I hope it will eventually run on its own (I‚Äôm still working on improving the speed).

## This project is a Work In Progress! It‚Äôs not ready to use yet. Descriptiob below is about the features I'm planning.

## Philosophy

**mo2git** is a helpful tool for MO2 users that makes it easy to collaborate on modlists using GitHub. You can think of it like Wabbajack, but mo2git uses a text format that works well with GitHub. It also allows you to run tools directly on a user‚Äôs computer, instead of making them download lots of files, like BodySlide-generated meshes or DDSOpt-optimized textures. This way, users will run BodySlide or DDSOpt on their own systems, saving lots of download time since they won‚Äôt have to download those gigabytes of files! And the image being smaller makes it easier to share on GitHub too!

In short, mo2git lets multiple people work on different parts of a mod list without interfering with each other. You‚Äôll have features like change tracking and pull requests, which are great for teamwork! ‚ùóüòÄ

Currently, mo2git uses Wabbajack for hashing and creating end-user images. I plan to keep this connection for now, but I want mo2git to eventually work on its own. This will allow sharing modlists that include paid mods, which isn‚Äôt allowed by Wabbajack. Just so you know, mo2git‚Äôs hashing and image creation are currently much slower than Wabbajack‚Äôs, so we will keep using WJ for a while.

### Similarities with Wabbajack

- You absoulutely must have a pristine Skyrim install. You should even keep SKSE and ENB out of your Skyrim folder by using the Root Builder plugin for MO2.
- You build a portable MO2 setup from "image" and files from your Downloads folder.

### Extra Features Compared to Wabbajack
- image is not a monolithic binary. Instead, it is a text file, with all the changes visible and understandable.
- **multiple ppl can now work on the same modlist. Yahoo!**
- change tracking. It is clear what has changed since previous version, and it can be rolled back easily. 
- pull requests from ppl outside of your immediate team. And you decide whethe4r to accept them or not. 

### Downsides Compared to Wabbajack

- No User Interface (UI): If you or someone else wants to create a GitHub project with a UI for mo2git, that would be great! I‚Äôm happy to support that by providing non-UI functions in mo2git, as long as your project uses a friendly license.
- Slower Performance: Right now, mo2git is slower when hashing and installing. I plan to make it faster by running some tasks in parallel, but let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs challenging to compete with C# when using Python.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- *Whatever you need to run your modlist.*
- *16GB RAM is a must; 32GB is super recommended.*
- *You‚Äôll also need 2x of extra space for your modlist, plus some more.*

### Accounts
- *Steam* - You‚Äôll need this for Skyrim.
- *[NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)* (preferably premium) - You‚Äôll use this for downloads.

### Installed Stuff
- *Steam*
- *Skyrim* (Make sure it‚Äôs a PRISTINE install folder)
- *Wabbajack* from [wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org/). *Don‚Äôt forget to log in to Nexus in WJ Settings! Eventually, this will be optional, but I‚Äôm keeping the integration with WJ (using their hash DB and generating WJ images from mo2git's images).*
- *You don‚Äôt necessarily need MO2 or tools like LOOT or xEdit‚Äîif you set up a COLLABWJ project right, those will get installed into \Modding\MO2 from the Wabbajack image.*
- *MSVC* can be grabbed from [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Just check the `Desktop Development with C++` box. You‚Äôll need this to install the `py7zr` and `bethesda-structs` Python modules.
- *Python v3.10+*. Grab it from [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). The latest version is perfect, and no, I'm not going to support Python 2. Make sure to add `py` to your PATH. You‚Äôll also need these modules:
  - xxhash: Install with `py -m pip install xxhash`
  - py7zr: Install with `py -m pip install py7zr`
  - bethesda-structs: Install with `py -m pip install bethesda-structs`

### Recommended
- *GitHub Desktop* [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

## Workflow Using GitHub

So, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôve got your hands at a mo2git-based GitHub project. We‚Äôll call it COLLAB. An example of this kind of project is [KTA](https://github.com/KTAGirl/KTA). Here‚Äôs how to work with it:

1. Install the Wabbajack image using the link from the COLLAB project or build it straight from COLLAB‚Äôs GitHub.
   - Make sure to follow all the usual Wabbajack steps (like having a pristine Skyrim folder).
   - In a well-set-up COLLAB project, you‚Äôll get an MO2 installation with most tools (like Bodyslide, FNIS, etc.) already set up.
   - You‚Äôll also set up your Downloads folder to download your archives (feel free to use your existing Downloads folder, I'm sure you‚Äôve got one, right? üòú).
   
2. Modify your installed modlist in MO2 portable instance (using Mod Organizer and included tools) to make that small change you want to make (think small changes‚Äîit‚Äôs like eating an elephant one bite at a time).
   - In a collaborative setup, keep changes small and merge them quickly. Otherwise, you‚Äôll lose a lot of the GitHub benefits. And if you let your copy sit too long without merging, resolving merge conflicts can get messy.
   
3. Clone the GitHub repo for the COLLAB project and mo2git.
4. Set up your folders:
   - By default, you‚Äôd set up C:\Modding\, with the WJ project in C:\Modding\<COLLAB-WJ>, and the GitHub stuff in C:\Modding\Github\mo2git and C:\Modding\Github\<COLLAB>. It should work with other setups too, but let me know if you hit any issues.
   
5. Run `COLLAB.py -mo2git` from inside the COLLAB folder.
   - This is where the magic happens. It will update your C:\Modding\Github\<COLLAB> to show your changes. 
   - Even though it‚Äôs written in single-threaded Python, it usually wraps up in just a few minutes.
   
6. Now you‚Äôve got your modified C:\Modding\Github\COLLAB. Now you can see the differences and commit directly to the project (if you‚Äôve got permissions) or submit a pull request.
   - To merge:
     - Every time you pull into \Modding\Github\COLLAB, you *have to* run `COLLAB.py -git2mo` (yep, that‚Äôs different from the one above ü§Ø). This updates your \Modding\COLLAB project with new changes from GitHub.
     - If a new COLLAB Wabbajack was released while you were working, you‚Äôll need to install that new Wabbajack file to a SEPARATE folder‚Äîlike C:\\Modding\COLLAB-WJ2\ ‚ùó‚Äîbut still use the same Downloads folder. mo2git doesn‚Äôt use this COLLAB-WJ2 install as is, but WJ will download new files and update its databases, which mo2git will use.
     - After that, keep merging your changes. As long as your edits don‚Äôt mess with the same files as the new GitHub changes, you‚Äôre golden. If there are conflicts, the usual GitHub merge rules apply for text files, and mo2git tries to keep binary file changes separate, so sometimes it‚Äôll still work out. Just know that conflicts can still happen, but it‚Äôs pretty rare IRL.
     - ([Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) is super recommended, but if you love the command line, that works too!)
   
7. You‚Äôre all done with your change!
   
8. To pull the new version, you‚Äôll need to:
   - Pull the new version of \Modding\Github\COLLAB
   - If available, install the new Wabbajack to \Modding\COLLAB-WJ2
   - Run `COLLAB.py -git2mo`

I know it sounds complicated, especially if you‚Äôre used to solo modding, but the perks of working together on modlists, like one person handling NPCs, another tweaking the environment, and someone else working on ENB or scripting‚Äîare huge!
