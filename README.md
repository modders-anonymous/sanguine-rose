# SanguineRose

**SanguineRose** is a Python-driven modpack development environment. It designed to help several people to work together on Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) setups using GitHub, allowing to create "mod packs" - bunches of mods carefully assembled together, to facilitate further modding. 

## This project is a Work In Progress! It‚Äôs not ready to use yet. Stay tuned! 

## Philosophy

### WTF is modpack?

We all know "mods" and "mod lists". Unfortunately, "mods" are way too small to deal with individually (managing 500 individual mods is quite an effort), and "mod list" is way too large, unwieldy, and tightly coupled to be easy to use (more often than not, mod lists are "closed" in a sense that there is very little chance to modify a typical mod list without breaking it). 

Imagine, how nice it would be if somebody made a bunch of mods - such as female appearance (3BA or BHUNP), or male appearance (SOS or SAM), or weather+ENB (whatever your fancy is), or FNIS+Nemesis, or whatever-else - with such a bunch of mods *easily re-usable*. Then, when making your own mod setup, you wouldn't need to master all the modding - and can concentrate on whatever your fancy is, building upon work of the others. 

Here it goes - a concept of **modpack** - a pack of closely-coupled mods. It can be as small as one single mod, or as large as the whole setup. What is important is that it should be *open* - in a sense, that adding another mod should not break too much. Mod packs can include other mod packs, allowing to create hierarchies, where each level adds its own value. 

modpack is similar to a *library* from traditional software development. It is a building block to enable development of larger things.

### On SanguineRose

**SanguineRose** is a tool for MO2 users that makes it easy to collaborate on modpack development using GitHub. *SanguineRose* is inspired by [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack), but is a completely separate development, with lots of improvements. 

In essence, SanguineRose-based project is a [JSON5](https://json5.org/) *instruction on 'how to build mod pack on the target box'*. And as it is a text-based instruction - it can be managed by using standard GitHub mechanisms (history tracking, merges, pull requests, and so on). 

## SanguineRose project as an automated 'how to build' instruction 

SanguineRose-based project is essentially just a (machine-executable, but human-readable) *instruction on 'how to build the MO2 folder' from Downloads folder"*. As in "go to such and such URL, get a file there, unpack it, and copy file X from the archive to this place within MO2 hierarchy". Rinse and repeat 10'000 times.

BTW, with SanguineRose (and unlike with WJ), you can easily see it on GitHub. build.json is this instruction I'm speaking about. 

### A Word to Modders

*SanguineRose* project, being merely an instruction, does not include any third-party copyrighted materials. With *SanguineRose* modpack (just like with Wabbajack modlist) users still have to download your mod from the site where you have posted it. 

And, as an improvement over Wabbajack, *SanguineRose* will provide a button to endorse all the mods included, and will advertise your Patreon, Discord, etc. 

Overall, I see it as *SanguineRose* aims to improve your bottom line (whether measured in endorsements or in bitcoins) by enabling Joe Average user to make complicated setups, and by taking honest users away from those swindling folks who publish those whole downloadable half-terabyte folders without author's permission. BTW, Wabbajack is based on the same concepts as *SanguineRose*, but *SanguineRose*'s implementation is cleaner, and a faithfully-built *SanguineRose* project has **exactly zero** third-party material (and if your mod is copied without your permission - you'll be able to see it on GitHub). 


## Comparison with Wabbajack
### Similarities with Wabbajack

- You absolutely must have a pristine Skyrim install. You should even keep SKSE and ENB out of your Skyrim folder by using the Root Builder plugin for MO2.
   + *SanguineRose* will help you with making your Skyrim folder pristine. 
- The idea is to build a portable MO2 setup from some downloadable "image", and files from your Downloads folder.

### Advantages over Wabbajack

- üìÇ mod packs. Mod pack is a *SanguineRose*-described bunch of closely related mods, which are only loosely related to the rest of the mod universe. For example, making a nice-looking female appearance mod pack (such as 3BA) is a piece of art by itself, but it does not interfere too much with environment modding, or with male appearance mod pack, or with quest mods. I hope that with time, there will be various mod packs all over github, so you can choose which ones to use as building blocks for your own modlist. It is all about division of labor,   specialization, and encouraging collaboration. 
- *SanguineRose* is independent and neutral. This is in contrast with Wabbajack, where top 2 contributors are from Nexus Mods. While WJ does not allow paid mods, SanguineRose is completely neutral about it; as a piece of really free software, SanguineRose doesn't feel like imposing any restrictions on the users, period. 
- *SanguineRose* will consider other mod sites as first-class citizens. In other words, if your mod is on LL or anywhere else, your mod will get the same treatment as mods from Nexus. Including screenshots, links, endorsements, and so on. 
- üìÑ *SanguineRose* image is not a monolithic binary. Instead, it is a github project (with JSON5 file at its heart), with all the changes visible and most of them even understandable.
- üë´ multiple ppl can now work on the same *SanguineRose* mod pack.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è *SanguineRose* also allows to re-use information such as "what's inside this particular archive", speeding things up.  
- üî®concept of transform: why uploading-downloading all those Bodyslide files  or DDSOpt-optimized textures, when they can be generated on the end-user box (using the same tools as you use, as all the tools and their config come in the same MO2 folder)?
- üî© automated file patch calculation and application 
- üí∞ *SanguineRose* itself does not have problems with paid mods. Modders also deserve to get paid, you know. Keep in mind that as a modder, it is your responsibility to comply with all the other licenses (including Bethesda's one).  
- üìÜ GitHub features, such as change tracking, merges, and pull requests. And it will be you deciding whether to accept pull request or not.
- üöÄ Faster Performance: *SanguineRose* is highly paralellized, and uses some significant improvements over WJ logic. *SanguineRose* is apparently already faster than Wabbajack, in spite of using allegedly slow Python rather than C#. Python rulezzzz! ü•á
- [FUTURE] an alternative way (using ReFS's CoW feature) to launch Skyrim without MO2 running and hooking into the game processes, may be a bit cleaner in runtime than MO2 at the cost of longer startup and shutdown times. Will still preserve MO2 compatibility, and will make MO-like development even cleaner than MO itself (I should be able to enforce that all writes go to overwrites, with both Skyrim and mod folders always kept pristine (well, after SanguineRose restores them back üòâ).

### Downsides Compared to Wabbajack

- ‚ùå No User Interface (UI): If you or someone else wants to create a GitHub project with a UI for SanguineRose, that would be great! I‚Äôm happy to support that by providing non-UI functions in SanguineRose, as long as your project uses a permissive license; no copyleft or other restrictions, please. This also means no stuff such as "Any quid-pro-quo payment structure in connection with... is strictly prohibited." either :angry: :rage: :scream: .


## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- *Whatever you need to run your modlist.*
- *16GB RAM is a must; 32GB is super recommended.*
- *You‚Äôll also need 2x of extra disk space for your modlist, plus some more.*

### Accounts
- *Steam* - You‚Äôll need this for Skyrim.
- *[NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)* (preferably premium) - You‚Äôll use this for downloads.

### Installed Stuff
- *Steam*
- *Skyrim* (Make sure it‚Äôs a PRISTINE install folder)
- *Wabbajack* from [wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org/). *Don‚Äôt forget to log in to Nexus in WJ Settings! Eventually, this will be optional, but I‚Äôm keeping the integration with WJ (using their hash DB and generating WJ images from SanguineRose's images).*
- *You don‚Äôt necessarily need MO2 or tools like LOOT or xEdit‚Äîif you set up a COLLABWJ project right, those will get installed into \Modding\MO2 from the Wabbajack image.*
- *MSVC* can be downloaded from [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Just check the `Desktop Development with C++` box. You‚Äôll need this to install the `py7zr` and `bethesda-structs` Python modules.
- *Python v3.10+*. Grab it from [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). The latest version is perfect, and no, I'm not going to support Python 2. Make sure to add `py` to your PATH environment variable.
- You‚Äôll also need the following Python modules: xxhash, psutil, py7zr, and bethesda-structs. To install all of them, simply run `SanguineRose-pip.bat` from SanguineRose project. **Prerequisite: MSVC (see above)**

### Recommended
- *GitHub Desktop* [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

## Workflow Using GitHub

So, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôve got your hands on a SanguineRose-based GitHub modlist. We‚Äôll call it COLLAB. An example of such a project is [KTA](https://github.com/KTAGirl/KTA). Here‚Äôs how to work with it:

1. Install the Wabbajack image using the link from the COLLAB project or build it straight from COLLAB‚Äôs GitHub.
   - Make sure to follow all the usual Wabbajack steps (like having a pristine Skyrim folder).
   - In a well-set-up COLLAB project, you‚Äôll get an MO2 installation with most tools (like Bodyslide, FNIS, etc.) already set up.
   - You‚Äôll also set up your Downloads folder to download your archives (feel free to use your existing Downloads folder, I'm sure you‚Äôve got one, right? üòú).
   
2. Modify your installed modlist in MO2 portable instance (using Mod Organizer and included tools) to make that small change you want to make (think small changes‚Äîit‚Äôs like eating an elephant one bite at a time).
   - In a collaborative setup, keep changes small and merge them quickly. Otherwise, you‚Äôll lose a lot of the GitHub benefits. And if you let your copy sit too long without merging, resolving merge conflicts can get messy.
   
3. Clone the GitHub repo for the COLLAB project and SanguineRose.
4. Set up your folders:
   - By default, you‚Äôd set up C:\Modding\, with the WJ project in C:\Modding\<COLLAB-WJ>, and the GitHub stuff in C:\Modding\Github\SanguineRose and C:\Modding\Github\<COLLAB>. It should work with other setups too, but let me know if you hit any issues.
   
5. Run `COLLAB.py -SanguineRose` from inside the COLLAB folder.
   - This is where the magic happens. It will update your C:\Modding\Github\<COLLAB> to show your changes. 
   - Even though it‚Äôs written in single-threaded Python, it usually wraps up in just a few minutes.
   
6. Now you‚Äôve got your modified C:\Modding\Github\COLLAB. Now you can see the differences and commit directly to the project (if you‚Äôve got permissions) or submit a pull request.
   - To merge:
     - Every time you pull into \Modding\Github\COLLAB, you *have to* run `COLLAB.py -git2mo` (yep, that‚Äôs different from the one above ü§Ø). This updates your \Modding\COLLAB project with new changes from GitHub.
     - If a new COLLAB Wabbajack was released while you were working, you‚Äôll need to install that new Wabbajack file to a SEPARATE folder‚Äîlike C:\\Modding\COLLAB-WJ2\ ‚ùó‚Äîbut still use the same Downloads folder. SanguineRose doesn‚Äôt use this COLLAB-WJ2 install as is, but WJ will download new files and update its databases, which SanguineRose will use.
     - After that, keep merging your changes. As long as your edits don‚Äôt mess with the same files as the new GitHub changes, you‚Äôre golden. If there are conflicts, the usual GitHub merge rules apply for text files, and SanguineRose tries to keep binary file changes separate, so sometimes it‚Äôll still work out. Just know that conflicts can still happen, but it‚Äôs pretty rare IRL.
     - ([Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) is super recommended, but if you love the command line, that works too!)
   
7. You‚Äôre all done with your change!
   
8. To pull the new version, you‚Äôll need to:
   - Pull the new version of \Modding\Github\COLLAB
   - If available, install the new Wabbajack to \Modding\COLLAB-WJ2
   - Run `COLLAB.py -git2mo`

I know it sounds complicated, especially if you‚Äôre used to solo modding, but the perks of working together on modlists, like one person handling NPCs, another tweaking the environment, and someone else working on ENB or scripting‚Äîare huge!
