# Sanguine Rose

**Sanguine Rose** is a *collaborative mod development environment*. It designed to help several people to work together on [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.modorganizer.org/) (MO2) setups using GitHub, and is centered around "modpacks" - bunches of mods carefully assembled together, to facilitate further modding. 

## This project is a Work In Progress! It‚Äôs not ready to use yet. Stay tuned! 

## WTF is modpack?

We all know "mods" and "mod lists". Unfortunately, "mods" are way too small to deal with individually (managing 500 individual mods is quite an effort), and "mod list" is way too large, unwieldy, and tightly coupled to be easy to use (more often than not, mod lists are "closed" in a sense that there is very little chance to modify a typical mod list without breaking it). 

Imagine, how nice it would be if somebody made a bunch of mods - such as female appearance (3BA or BHUNP), or male appearance (SOS or SAM), or weather+ENB (whatever your fancy is), or FNIS+Nemesis, or whatever-else - with such a bunch of mods _easily re-usable_. Then, when making your own mod setup, you wouldn't need to master all the modding - and can concentrate on whatever your fancy is, _building upon work of the others_. 

Here it goes - a concept of **modpack** - a pack of closely related mods, which are only loosely related to the rest of the mods out there. In theory, it can be as small as one single mod, or as large as the whole setup, but such extremes are usually not too practical. What is important is that developers should try to keep their modpacks *open* - in a sense, that adding another mod should not break too much. Modpacks can include other modpacks, allowing to create hierarchies, where each level adds its own value. 

modpack is similar to a *library* from traditional software development. It is a building block to enable development of larger things. Ideally, just as any software library, modpacks should be ["highly cohesive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)#High_cohesion) within the modpack, and only ["loosely coupled"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)) with other modpacks and individual mods. 

## On Sanguine Rose

**Sanguine Rose** is a tool for MO2 users that makes it easy to collaborate on modpack development using GitHub. *Sanguine Rose* is inspired by [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack), but is a completely separate development, with lots of improvements. 


### An automated 'how to build' instruction 

In essence, each Sanguine Rose-based project is just a (machine-executable, but human-readable) *instruction on 'how to build the MO2 folder' from Downloads folder"*. As in "go to such and such URL, get a file there, unpack it, and copy file X from the archive to this place within MO2 hierarchy". Rinse and repeat 200'000 times.

BTW, with Sanguine Rose (and unlike with WJ), you can easily see this instruction on GitHub. build.json (which is actually a [JSON5](https://json5.org/) file) is this instruction, so the whole thing is absolutely transparent. And as it is a text-based instruction - it can be managed by using standard GitHub mechanisms (history tracking, merges, pull requests, and so on). 

### Using in lieu of Wabbajack

*Sanguine Rose* can be used to describe arbitrarily large modpacks, to the extent of the whole setup. In this sense, it can be used as a replacement for Wabbajack. Still, I am encouraging modpack developers to build your *Sanguine Rose* projects in modular manner, reusing work of the others, and keeping things "open" for the downstream changes. I cannot prohibit using *Sanguine Rose* in other manner, but huge closed monolithic setups are certainly not what *Sanguine Rose* is designed for. 

## A Word to Mod Authors

*Sanguine Rose* project, being merely a *'how to build' instruction*, does not include any third-party copyrighted materials. With *Sanguine Rose* modpack (just like with Wabbajack modlist) users **still have to download your mod from the site where you have posted it**.

### Why Sanguine Rose is Beneficial for mod authors

- üì¢ Overall, *Sanguine Rose* aims to improve your bottom line (whether measured in endorsements or in bitcoins) by enabling Joe Average user to make complicated setups, and by taking honest users away from those swindling folks who publish those whole downloadable half-terabyte folders without author's permission.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è *Sanguine Rose* will provide a button to endorse all the mods included, and will advertise mod author's links to Patreon, Discord, etc. 
- üëì *Sanguine Rose* projects are 100% transparent. A faithfully-built *Sanguine Rose* project should contain **exactly zero** third-party material (and if your mod is copied without your permission - you'll be able to see it on GitHub, and ask GitHub to remove it). This is a major improvement over non-transparent Wabbajack images.
- üîß I realize perfectly well that supporting users who are using 3rd-party modpacks, is not an option. However, *supporting modpack writers - who take care of supporting their users themselves - will save you a lot of effort*. After all, supporting 1 modpack developer is easier than supporting 100 users, and also we can expect that modpack developers are more dedicated and more knowledgeable than mod users.
- üîì Last but not least, *Sanguine Rose* considers *all* mod authors as first-class citizens, *regardless of where they post their mods*. In other words, if your mod is on Loverslab (or anywhere else for that matter), it will get the same treatment as mods from Nexus (well, as long as I can get a permission from site owner). This will include screenshots while installing, links to your Patreon/Discord, bulk endorsements, and so on. This is a major improvement over Nexus-centric Wabbajack.

## Comparison with Wabbajack
### Similarities with Wabbajack

- You absolutely must have a pristine Skyrim install. You should even keep SKSE and ENB out of your Skyrim folder by using the Root Builder plugin for MO2.
   + *Sanguine Rose* will help you with making your Skyrim folder pristine. 
- The idea is to build a portable MO2 setup from some downloadable "image", and files from your Downloads folder.

### Advantages over Wabbajack

- üìÇ modpacks. Modpack is a *Sanguine Rose*-described bunch of closely related mods, which are only loosely related to the rest of the mod universe. For example, making a nice-looking female appearance modpack (such as 3BA) is a piece of art by itself, but it does not interfere too much with environment modding, or with male appearance modpack, or with quest mods. I hope that with time, there will be various modpacks all over github, so you can choose which ones to use as building blocks for your own modpack or setup. It is all about division of labor,   specialization, and encouraging collaboration. 
- üóΩ*Sanguine Rose* is independent and neutral. This is in contrast with Wabbajack, where top 2 contributors are from Nexus Mods. Among other things it means that while WJ does not allow paid mods, Sanguine Rose is completely neutral about it; as a piece of truly free software, Sanguine Rose doesn't feel like imposing any restrictions on the users, period. 
- üìÑ *Sanguine Rose* image is not a monolithic binary. Instead, it is a github project (with JSON5 file at its heart), with all the changes visible and most of them even understandable.
- üë´ multiple ppl can now work on the same *Sanguine Rose* modpack.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è *Sanguine Rose* allows to share and re-use information such as "what's inside this particular archive", speeding things up (for such known archives, there is no need to extract and hash them locally on each box, saving time and CO2 footprint).  
- üî® concept of transform: why uploading-downloading all those Bodyslide files  or DDSOpt-optimized textures, when they can be generated on the end-user box (using the same tools as you use, as all the tools and their config come in the same MO2 folder)?
- üî© automated file patch calculation and application 
- üí∞ *Sanguine Rose* as such does not have problems with paid mods. Modders also deserve to get paid, you know. Keep in mind that as a modder, it is your responsibility to comply with all the other licenses (including Bethesda's one).  
- üìÜ GitHub features, such as change tracking, merges, and pull requests. And it will be you deciding whether to accept pull request or not.
- üöÄ Better Performance: *Sanguine Rose* is highly paralellized, and uses some significant improvements over WJ logic. *Sanguine Rose* is apparently already faster than Wabbajack, in spite of using allegedly slow Python rather than C#. Python rulezzzz! ü•á
- [PLANNED] ability to "mo2ify" existing non-MO ("overwrite-based, OMG") setup. We probably have enough information to start educated guesses. 
- [FUTURE] an alternative way (using ReFS's CoW feature) to launch Skyrim without MO2 running and hooking into the game processes, may be a bit cleaner in runtime than MO2 at the cost of longer startup and shutdown times. Will still preserve MO2 compatibility, and will make MO-like development even cleaner than MO itself (I should be able to enforce that all writes go to overwrites, with both Skyrim and mod folders always kept pristine (well, after Sanguine Rose restores them back üòâ).

### Downsides Compared to Wabbajack

- ‚ùå No User Interface (UI): If you or someone else wants to create a GitHub project with a UI for Sanguine Rose, that would be great! I‚Äôm happy to support that by providing non-UI functions in Sanguine Rose, as long as your project uses a permissive license; no copyleft or other restrictions, please. This also means no stuff such as "Any quid-pro-quo payment structure in connection with... is strictly prohibited." either :angry: :rage: :scream: .


## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- *Whatever you need to run your setup.*
- *16GB RAM is a must; 32GB is super recommended.*
- *You‚Äôll also need additional disk space, quite a bit of it.*

### Accounts
- *Steam* - You‚Äôll need this for Skyrim or Fallout.
- *[NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)* (preferably premium) - You‚Äôll use this for downloads.
- Accounts for all the other mod sites you are going to use (such as [LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/))

### Installed Stuff
- *Steam*
- *Skyrim* (Make sure it‚Äôs a PRISTINE install folder)
- *You don‚Äôt necessarily need to install MO2 or tools like LOOT or xEdit separately. If you set up your YOUR-MODPACK project right, those will get installed into your portable MO2 instance by Sanguine Rose.*
- *Python v3.10+*. Grab it from [Python Releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). The latest version is perfect, and no, I'm not going to support Python 2. Make sure to add `py` to your PATH environment variable.
- You‚Äôll also need to run sanguine-install.py from sanguine-rose project. It will download and install several things we need. 

### Recommended
- *GitHub Desktop* [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

## Workflow Using GitHub

So, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôve got your hands on a *Sanguine Rose*-based GitHub modpack. We‚Äôll call it YOUR-MODPACK. An example of such a project is [KTA](https://github.com/KTAGirl/KTA). Here‚Äôs how to work with it:

1. Clone YOUR-MODPACK GitHub project. Run `YOUR-MODPACK.bat -install` from it. 
   - It may take a while, but in a well-set-up YOUR-MODPACK project, as a result of running `YOUR-MODPACK.bat -install`, you‚Äôll get an MO2 installation with most tools (like Bodyslide, FNIS, etc.) already set up.
   - You‚Äôll also set up your Downloads folder to download your archives (feel free to use your existing Downloads folder, I'm sure you‚Äôve got one, right? üòú). Multiple Downloads folders are supported too. 
   
2. Modify your installed modpack in MO2 portable instance (using Mod Organizer and included tools) to make that small change you want to make (think small changes‚Äîit‚Äôs like eating an elephant one bite at a time).
   - If there are several people working on the same modpack, try keep changes small and merge them quickly. Otherwise, you‚Äôll lose a lot of the GitHub benefits. And if you let your copy sit too long without merging, resolving merge conflicts can get messy.
   
3. Clone the GitHub repo for the YOUR-MODPACK project and Sanguine Rose.
4. Set up your folders:
   - By default, you‚Äôd set up C:\Modding\, with the *Sanguine Rose*-based project in C:\Modding\<YOUR-MODPACK>, and the GitHub stuff in C:\Modding\Github\sanguine-rose and C:\Modding\Github\<YOUR-MODPACK>. It should work with other setups too, but let me know if you hit any issues.
   
5. Run `YOUR-MODPACK.bat -mo2git` from inside the YOUR-MODPACK folder.
   - This is where the magic happens. It will update your C:\Modding\Github\<YOUR-MODPACK> to show your changes. 
   - Even though it‚Äôs written in single-threaded Python, it usually wraps up in just a few minutes.
   
6. Now you‚Äôve got your modified C:\Modding\Github\YOUR-MODPACK. Now you can see the differences and commit directly to the project (if you‚Äôve got permissions) or submit a pull request.
   - To merge:
     - Every time you pull into \Modding\Github\YOUR-MODPACK, you *have to* run `YOUR-MODPACK.bat -git2mo` (yep, that‚Äôs different from the one above ü§Ø). This updates your \Modding\YOUR-MODPACK project with new changes from GitHub.
     - After that, keep merging your changes. As long as your edits don‚Äôt mess with the same files as the new GitHub changes, you‚Äôre golden. If there are conflicts, the usual GitHub merge rules apply for text files, and Sanguine Rose tries to keep binary file changes separate, so sometimes it‚Äôll still work out. Just know that conflicts can still happen, but it‚Äôs pretty rare IRL.
     - ([Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) is super recommended, but if you love the command line, that works too!)
   
7. You‚Äôre all done with your change!
   
8. To pull the new version, you‚Äôll need to:
   - Pull the new version of \Modding\Github\YOUR-MODPACK
   - Run `YOUR-MODPACK.bat -git2mo`

I know it sounds complicated, especially if you‚Äôre used to solo modding, but the perks of working together on modpacks, like one person handling NPCs, another tweaking the environment, and someone else working on ENB or scripting‚Äîare huge!
